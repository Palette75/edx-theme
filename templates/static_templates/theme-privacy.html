<h3>CONFIDENTIALITY & SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>
We care about the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information (as defined below) secure. However, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to or stored by the NoticeAbility.org website (the “Site,” which consists of all content and pages located within the noticeability.org web domain). As used in this Privacy Policy, “NoticeAbility,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to NoticeAbility Inc., the owner of the Site.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Security</h4>
The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the Site and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax or through conventional mail).
</p>
<p>

If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not access, browse, submit information to, or register for the Site. As used in this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information” means any information about yourself that you may provide to us when using the Site which may include (but is not limited to) your name, contact information, gender, date of birth, and occupation.

Some of the information is collected through cookies (small text files placed on your computer that store information about you, which can be accessed by the Site). You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the “Help” section of the toolbar.
