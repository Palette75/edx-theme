As part of your registration, you will be prompted to submit a photo of yourself, along with one other form of photo identification (“photo ID”).

<li>
In addition, the processing of your payment information is done by an NoticeAbility third party vendor, and you will be re-routed to a secure website to complete the payment transaction. The privacy statement posted at the payment landing page operated by such third party vendor will govern the submission and processing of your payment details. Please familiarize yourself with those terms prior to initiating a transaction.
</li>
<li>
Once your payment transaction is completed, you will be re-routed back to an NoticeAbility confirmation page and will receive a confirmation email with your name, order number and the payment amount. Please retain this email for your records as this information will be required if you seek a refund from NoticeAbility, as described below.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
  </ul>
